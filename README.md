Things to retrieve from json match file:
-  riotIdGameName
  - info -> participants -> riotIdGameName


What I have built so far:
- frontend can talk to the backend at the moment
  - not much user input at the moment
  - need to be able to enter the summoner name and tagline
  - create the match data file based off of that in the backend
  - which then populates all the front end data that the user will see
  - still going to go with the idea of populating a spreadsheet-esque component
- have a few methods that get some data
  - need to figure out what other data I want to get
- have to organize the frontend into more components
- need to start building a database to store the json data and have the state automatically update based on the information inside of the last match json file
